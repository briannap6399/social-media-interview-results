## Greetings!

If you are now reading this, these are the results of several interviews I've conducted throughout January 10th-15th, which focused on the Impacts Social Media has had on the Neurodivergent Community.
The Interview consisted of 10 Questions, with an additional 11th Question asking if the interviewee would like to remain anonymous upon posting the results publicly. As of writing this, I've recieved over 9 different responses, all talking about their experiences on Social Media.
