## Greetings to everyone who happens to see this README.

My name is Brianna Peralta, and over the course of January 9th-January 15th, I had sought out to Interview those in the Neurodivergent Community about their experiences with social media. This Interview targeted how Social Media has impacted them, emeotionally or mentally.

With the consent of everyone involved, the results of their responses will be shared on this Github Repository. There were 11 Questions, with the last one asking people if they'd want to be left anonymous as I post the results. Those who wanted to be left anonymous had their responses put into a separate folder from those who were eager to be let their responses be known.

By the time you've finished reading this README, there will be 3 Links by the bottom of this small paragraph. Clicking the first link will take you to the Interview Questions, (Side note, they will be posted for every interview as well, but this link will a clear visual of all the questions) the second link will take you to the anonymous folder, where you can see the anonymous interview, and the final link will do the same as the one before, though it'll instead lead you to the public folder, and it'll show you multiple interviews.

As a member of the Neurodivergent Community myself, I had fun orchestrating these Interviews. I loved the fact that everyone treated a serious topic such as the mental health of the Neurodivergent Community appropriately. It makes me eager to do a similar Interview in the near future. With that said, thank you for reading this README, and have fun sifting through the other folders!
