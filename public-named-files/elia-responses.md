1) How long have you been using social media?

   Elia: If using YouTube just to watch videos counts then about 10 to 11 years I think, if not I actively started using discord and a little Twitter about 1 to 2 years ago, even the account git made before but didn't have much of a use, I also used more frequently twitch and was an active chatter in a streamer chat for like 6 years now I think.

 2) What social media app have you used the most throughout the duration of your life?

   Elia: YouTube just for watching videos, if you count activity then twitch probably.

 3) What are your experiences with your most used app? (Positive and Negative are fine)

   Elia: YouTube it's mainly positive, it's how I came to know about a lot of my favorite games and it's like a substitute for TV, with twitch my most used app where I'm like active also great, being part of a chat of a small community it's like everyone knows everyone else and the community there is great and made me know some people.

4) Have you felt any negative feelings that were brought upon by another social media user?

   Elia: Yes but they weren't massively negative, still negative.

5) Have you ever felt emotional attachment towards something or someone featured on social media? If so, what or who? (You can be vague with this one)

   Elia: Anyway I think that I could say the streamer I usually watch but it's not an extreme attachment. It's Italian Swiss so you don't know him but the name is Letal.

 6) Whenever you feel anxious or stressed thanks to social media, what do you do to try and calm yourself?

   Elia: I either 1 sleep, 2 play an offline video game or 3 go outside to eat or do grocery or do whatever else outside to keep my mind at peace.

7) Would you say your experience on social media is more positive or negative?

    Elia: Definitely positive I think.

 8) How would you describe "Internet Drama"? Have you experienced it? If so, tell me how.

    Elia: Drama but on the internet and it spreads like wildfire and can cause from x times to 10 times the normal damage. First person? no, just heard of it from others, or people I knew little, I try to avoid it.

9) Have you ever taken any breaks due to social media? If yes, tell me the duration of these breaks.

    Elia: Not really, maybe when on vacation just cause I don't have time for the phone.

10) Without asking around or doing proper research, do you think that a lot of people in the neurodivergent community have seen/engaged with internet drama? Explain why or why not.

    Elia: On instinct I would say less because I feel like they would try to avoid conflict, but at the same time I feel like they are more likely, so it evens out I guess?

11) Are you alright with this being quoted for the overall essay? (If yes, give the name you'd like for me to use)

    Elia: Yeah, Elia works.
