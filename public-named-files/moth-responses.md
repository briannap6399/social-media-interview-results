1) How long have you been using social media?

    Moth: I've been on social media for a LONG time, 9 years at most. Hell, maybe longer!

 2) What social media app have you used the most throughout the duration of your life?

    Moth: It's Instagram. At least, it's the farthest back, most used one I can remember.

 3) What are your experiences with your most used app? (Positive and Negative are fine)

    Moth: My experiences were a mixed bag... I had a few good ones, uploading with friends, connecting with my schoolmates. But, I feel like it opened up more opportunities for me to be attacked, and I suffered from that.

4) Have you felt any negative feelings that were brought upon by another social media user?

    Moth: Yeah, multiple times. Mainly bullies, although when I got twitter and/or reddit, a few misunderstandings, and a few opinions led me to be accosted.

5) Have you ever felt emotional attachment towards something or someone featured on social media? If so, what or who? (You can be vague with this one)

    Moth: Not really, except in the case of tumblr. It's always nice seeing mutuals and I regard them as friends, almost.

 6) Whenever you feel anxious or stressed thanks to social media, what do you do to try and calm yourself?

    Moth: Put the phone down, and distract myself. It can be anything. A game, videos, maybe a book, or art. When you get a chance to process something fully and not overanalyze it all in one go, while not worrying about it, it's a good way to deal with it.

 7) Would you say your experience on social media is more positive or negative?

    Moth: Positive. Most of the positivity is from tumblr, mind, but being able to connect with others who share the same interest was always nice, even with the drawbacks.

 8) How would you describe "Internet Drama"? Have you experienced it? If so, tell me how.

    Moth: I'd call it a pebble fight. Groups of people, angry at each other or something, throwing small rocks at their problem... While it does have a time and a place (that being to expose dangerous or otherwise bad things like company fraud or manipulative/abusive people) I've found that most of the time this leads to next to nothing. I used to partake a long time ago, but usually only let it sour my mood.

9) Have you ever taken any breaks due to social media? If yes, tell me the duration of these breaks.

   Moth: I've not really taken any breaks since Instagram. Bad people, cut them off, haven't thought about it. Most of those breaks were simply for at most a week. I usually just don't use social media too much.

10) Without asking around or doing proper research, do you think that a lot of people in the neurodivergent community have seen/engaged with internet drama? Explain why or why not.

   Moth: I'd say so. I've gotten extremely angry over drama, and, with this sort of thing irritating most if not almost everybody, it could also provide another reason for neurodivergence to be angry. (perhaps the drama specifically targets something about them.)

11) Are you alright with this being quoted for the overall essay? (If yes, give the name you'd like for me to use)

   Moth: Yeah, I'm fine with being Quoted. Mothy's fine for a quote name, if it'd be preferred, Jack also works.
