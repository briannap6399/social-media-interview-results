1) How long have you been using social media?

    Hansel: Since I was about 5.

 2) What social media app have you used the most throughout the duration of your life?

    Hansel: Roblox and YouTube.

 3) What are your experiences with your most used app? (Positive and Negative are fine)

    Hansel: Pretty good overall with Roblox!! Some kids are rude which sucks, but it’s fine. YouTube introduced me to some pretty f*cked up stuff, though.

4) Have you felt any negative feelings that were brought upon by another social media user?

    Hansel: Yeah, sometimes. I’m getting a lot better at taking online insults and not caring though.

5) Have you ever felt emotional attachment towards something or someone featured on social media? If so, what or who? (You can be vague with this one)

    Hansel: Yes!! Basically any YouTuber I subscribe to, I hate unsubscribing because what if it hurts their feelings??? Even though I know reasonably that it won’t.

 6) Whenever you feel anxious or stressed thanks to social media, what do you do to try and calm yourself?

    Hansel: Take a break!! I usually play mindless idle games, but if you can do something intellectually stimulating that’s even better.

 7) Would you say your experience on social media is more positive or negative?

    Hansel: It started out positive, got really bad really fast, and is slowly getting to be more positive.

 8) How would you describe "Internet Drama"? Have you experienced it? If so, tell me how.

    Hansel: Yikes, it’s just a whole lot of people being mad at things that don’t matter. I have experienced it, actually, usually when I take inspiration from someone’s art and recreate the pose one or two people always accuse me of tracing, lol.

9) Have you ever taken any breaks due to social media? If yes, tell me the duration of these breaks.

    Hansel: Not of my own volition, but about a year was the longest I’d gone with no social media at all after being introduced.

10) Without asking around or doing proper research, do you think that a lot of people in the neurodivergent community have seen/engaged with internet drama? Explain why or why not.

    Hansel: Yes!! A lot of them are the subject of it, really, especially in the eyes of cringe culture.

11) Are you alright with this being quoted for the overall essay? (If yes, give the name you'd like for me to use)

    Hansel: Also, yes!! You can use Hansel, Angel, Strawbz, rlly (Really) any of those<3.
