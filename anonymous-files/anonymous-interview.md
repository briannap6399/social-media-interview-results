7) Would you say your experience on social media is more positive or negative?

8) How would you describe "Internet Drama"? Have you experienced it? If so, tell me how.

9) Have you ever taken any breaks due to social media? If yes, tell me the duration of these breaks.

10) Without asking around or doing proper research, do you think that a lot of people in the neurodivergent community has seen/engaged with internet drama? Explain why or why not.

11) Are you alright with this being quoted for the overall essay? (If yes, give the name you'd like for me to use)



# Numbered Clips were Bri's Questions

 1) How long have you been using social media?

 For as long as i remember, honestly; been shoved a phone into the face at quite an early age



2. YT has definitely been there for years, shaping me into... mostly what i am now (you can tell)

3) What are your experiences with your most used app? (Positive and Negative are fine)

Again, it shaped me into what i am, which is both a positive... and a negative
influenced my opinions, behaviors, i guess even how i think and stuff
that is a big can of worms, ill say.

4) Have you felt any negative feelings that were brought upon by another social media user?

There's only one person i can definitely remember that would be the closest to fitting this answer
not sure if i wanna talk about them
not sure if it's because ive already said things about her or if it's because i dont wanna go another trip down that memory lane, but either way... just, yeah.

5) Have you ever felt emotional attachment towards something or someone featured on social media. If so, what or who? (You can be vague with this one)

*Extends and shakes hands towards girlfriend like it's the end of a musical number and im introducing someone new* /silly
(no im being serious here btw, she's the only thing keeping me together at this point
if i were to type out how much im attached to her and why, id never shut up)

6) Whenever you feel anxious or stressed thanks to social media, what do you do to try and calm yourself?

Is it funny that crossdressing was my first way of coping with being overwhelmed by those stuff??
it's a little story in of itself tbh lol

7. ill still say it's a 50/50... roughly-

8. ive definitely seen my fair share of those instances
the best i can say is that it's a conflicting disagreement between people online, which more or less tends to escalate as either side tries to beat the other up
i think
im not really using the best of my braincells today so sorry if im wrong

9. it varies

10. id say they do
while they're more accepted these days (ðŸŽ‰), i still sometimes see them getting belittled and shit for just being neurodivergent; it's all 100% online because the internet's one of the few places where you can say tons of shit and not get kicked in the balls as long as you're anonymous as hell lol

i hope these answers were a-okay, like i said it's quite a lot to take in (for me), so
yeah! âœ¨
